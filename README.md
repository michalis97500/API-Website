# API-Website
This repository was a small project I had done out of curiosity about website, front-end and back-end development

Background:
In early 2021 a couple of friends and I have started mining cryptocurrencies, however keeping updates on our
machine had proven to be difficult. To solve that, I have developed a simple website to connect to multiple
API's and pull information on the machine as well as store important details on a google sheet.

Note:
In the website folder there are 2 files missing : database.db & __init__.py
These are not included for security reasons, feel free to contact me if you want a sample of those
